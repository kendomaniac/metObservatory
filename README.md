# metObservatory
Infrastructure to acquire information on Met gene

To build the image, stay in metObservatory folder and execute:

```
docker build --tag docker.io/repbioinfo/metobservatory_2020.03 .

```

## software

### primary.R

It creates two folders for each tumor primary site in the TCGA, one for bam files and another for vcf files. The above folders are created in /scratch folder, which is the mounting point to a disk where you wish to download TCAG data. In each folder there is a manifest file to retrieve respectively RNAseq STAR 2 steps bam files or MuTect2 vcf for each sample in the manifest files.

```
ID=$(docker run -i -t -d -v /somewhere/in/your/computer:/scratch \ 
docker.io/repbioinfo/metobservatory_2020.02 /bin/bash)
docker attach $ID
R CMD BATCH /scripts/primary.R
```

Check primary.Rout to be sure that all folders manifests were correctly crerated.


### gdc-client

TCGA application to download data from TCGA, it requires a manifest and a user token.

- start a docker istance:

```
ID=$(docker run -i -t -d -v /somewhere/in/your/computer:/scratch \ 
docker.io/repbioinfo/metobservatory_2020.04 /bin/bash)
docker attach $ID
```

- locate your working directory in the folder where the manifest of interest is present:
    
 ``` 
 cd /scratch/adrenal_gland_bam/
/usr/local/bin/gdc-client download -m ./manifest.txt -t ../gdc-user-token.2020-08-17XXX_YY_ZZ.NNNN.txt -n 16
```

- as other option you can run the gdc-client outside docker editing and running the script executing_docker_gdc_download.sh

		+ copy executing_docker_gdc_download.sh in the local folder mounted as /scratch e.g. /home/rcaloger/data/
		
		+ edit the script changing IDTISSUE, IDTYPE, WORKING_DIR and SCRATCH_DIR

 ``` 
 #!/usr/bin/bash
 IDCORE=docker_
 IDTISSUE=bronchus_
 IDTYPE=bam
 ID=$IDCORE$IDTISSUE$IDTYPE
 WORKING_DIR=/scratch/bronchus_and_lung_bam
 SCRATCH_DIR=/home/rcaloger/data/
 
 ID is the dockerid that is saved in the upper folder with respect to the working dir the default is /home/rcaloger/data/
 /home/rcaloger/data/ is mounted as /scratch in the docker
 
 WORKING_DIR is one folder created by primary.R
  
```

#### clean_manifest.R

It is a script that creates a new manifest file in case the download is interrupted for some reason. Please edit the script inserting the part of the manifest to be edited and the new name for the manifest. Please remember to edit the xecuting_docker_gdc_download.sh changing the name of the manifest

### extract Met and all chimeric reads

This is a python script that extract reads at the Met locus using samtools, then uses a specific c++ program to extract all reads which are not mapped or chimeric.

- start a docker istance:

```
ID=$(docker run -i -t -d -v /home/rcaloger/data:/scratch  \ 
docker.io/repbioinfo/metobservatory_2020.04 /bin/bash)
docker attach $ID
```

- locate your working directory upstream the folder where the bam downloaded with the manifest of interest are present, e.g. adrenal_gland_bam_ok:
    
 ``` 
 cd /scratch/
/scripts/shrinkBam.py /scratch/adrenal_gland_bam_ok
```

- as other option you can run the gdc-client outside docker editing and running the script executing_docker_met_others.sh

		+ copy executing_docker_met_others.sh in the local folder mounted as /scratch e.g. /home/rcaloger/data/
		
		+ edit the script changing IDTISSUE, IDTYPE, WORKING_DIR and SCRATCH_DIR

 ``` 
 #!/usr/bin/bash
 IDCORE=extract_
 IDTISSUE=adrenal_
 IDTYPE=bam
 ID=$IDCORE$IDTISSUE$IDTYPE
 WORKING_DIR=/scratch/adrenal_gland_bam_ok
 SCRATCH_DIR=/home/rcaloger/data/
 
 ID is the dockerid that is saved in the upper folder with respect to the working dir the default is /home/rcaloger/data/
 /home/rcaloger/data/ is mounted as /scratch in the docker
 
 WORKING_DIR is one folder created by primary.R
  
```

- execute locally executing_docker_met_others.sh e.g. /home/rcaloger/data/

#### processed_folders.py

TRhis python script generate a list of folder where the extract Met and all chimeric reads script failed. The file generated has the names of all dir in which met.sam and other.bam is not present. This output file can be easily modified to move these folders somewhere else to finish the data processing, see example below.

```

the file il called ls_to-be-processed.sh
change the file below:
04572e38-8baf-4a05-bf63-7c6a7a6dbee5
04a7f289-c045-474e-8b2e-99ca8016539f
04b5d18e-88c4-403f-987a-63b048808a87
04d27335-5340-4c7d-a651-d673e2d4e080
05275795-1405-45c3-9f72-938be4b20840
0537ed83-8981-499f-b324-2000bd8c8805

in:
mv 04572e38-8baf-4a05-bf63-7c6a7a6dbee5 ./to_be_processed							
mv 04a7f289-c045-474e-8b2e-99ca8016539f ./to_be_processed							
mv 04b5d18e-88c4-403f-987a-63b048808a87 ./to_be_processed							
mv 04d27335-5340-4c7d-a651-d673e2d4e080 ./to_be_processed							
mv 05275795-1405-45c3-9f72-938be4b20840 ./to_be_processed							
mv 0537ed83-8981-499f-b324-2000bd8c8805 ./to_be_processed	

To execute it:
chmod +x ls_to-be-processed.sh
./ls_to-be-processed.sh

Then you can modify executing_docker_met_others.sh to finish the data processing

### BFCounter

BFCounter identifies all the k-mers that occur more than once in a DNA sequence data set. BFCounter uses a Bloom filter, a probabilistic data structure that stores all the observed k-mers implicitly in memory with greatly reduced memory requirements.

BFCounter is available in /bin from metobservatory_2020.05
The script executing_BFCounter.sh allow k-mer generation from a folder in which is present the fastq.gz
